# Movies-ETL
This project was an introduction tp performing an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL). The data set Movie data originates from Wikipedia, Kaggle and  implement a rating systsem on order to create a movie database from a clean dataset. The cleaning set incorporates cleaning rows and formating datatypes, preforming joins, and loading the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.

# Overview
Our intention is to create an automated pipline that can ETL proccess we previously did manually. A synopsisv of the movie dataset comes from 1990 to 2018 and combining the information from 3 different resources.

# Results
## ETL_function_test.ipynb
- Data is extracted from the website in JSON and CSV formats.
-Data is transformed into Pandas data frames.
-JSON file requires extra step â€“ loading file first and then transforming into data frame.

## ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb
- Function clean_movie combines scattered data of alternative languages into one column alt_titles.
- Its subfunction change_column_name organizes column names into consistent pattern.
- In the function extract_transform_load the transformation process of wiki movies data begins and includes:
  * Python list comprehensions.
  * apply() and map() methods in combination with lambda functions.
  * regular expressions or RegEx.

 ## ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb
 - Function extract_transform_load gets new tasks for cleaning Kaggle data and includes:
  * Changing datatypes, using methods pd.to_numeric, astype() and python comparison operators for Boolean types.
  * Filling missing values and filtering unwanted columns.
  *  Merging data frames using pd_merge method.

## ETL_create_database.ipynb
- The function in its final step connects to the database by sqlalchemy library and to_sql method.
- Complete ETL process can be executed with a single function extract_transform_load call.

The final results created a movies table with 6,052 rows. We see a reduction by 17% from the original of 7,311 and a ratings table with 26,024,289 rows.
